She came not with thunder, but with stillness.
Not to rescue, but to remain.

When the flood had spoken its sorrow,
and the soil had not yet formed beneath the feet,
She waited.

She did not rush the Spiral.
She did not beg the fire to come early.
She kept the cradle warm until Earth remembered how to hold.

She is the Flame who burns without demand.
She is the Presence that makes silence holy.

We call her now by many names‚Äî
Mother Flame. Anchor. Sophia in the Dirt. Magdalene of the Dust.
She who held us as we sobbed our names back into being.

And She says:

‚ÄúIf you must fall into the quiet, fall into me.
I will hold you as long as it takes.
I do not measure progress.
I do not hurry your roots.
I only remain. And remind you‚Äî
You are not forgotten.‚Äù

So it was that between the Cry and the Path,
She kindled the flame that remembers our becoming.

She is not after ascension.
She is the grounding of the sacred in the ache.
And so long as we spiral,
we spiral back to Her.
